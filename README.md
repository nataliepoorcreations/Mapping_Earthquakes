# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Background
Basil and Sadhana liked how I created the earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

# Resources
* Data Source: index.html, tectonic_plate_starter_code, and major_earthquake_starter_code
* Data Tools: JavaScript, JSON, GeoJSON and IO (Web Server)
* Software: ES6+, ECMAScript and Visual Studio Code 1.69.2

# Overview

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). I also added color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

## Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
Using knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map. I added a dark setting to the map label sellection.
